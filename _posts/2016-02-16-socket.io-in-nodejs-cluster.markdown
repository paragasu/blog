Running nodejs in cluster is a bit tricky. We need to make sure the same
worker handle the same connection from the same client.  

To make life a little bit easier, we can use [Sticky Session](https://github.com/indutny/sticky-session)

    $npm install sticky-session 

And we need to use socket.io-redis to make sure we can send message 
to socket handle by different workers.

    $npm install socket.io-redis
