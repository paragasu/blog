<p><strong>extern </strong>-  Variables described by extern statements will not have any space allocated for them, as they should be properly defined elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>static</strong> - The static data type modifier is used to create permanent storage for variables. Static variables keep their value between function calls. When used in a class, all instantiations of that class share one copy of the variable.</p>
<p><strong>const</strong> - The const keyword can be used to tell the compiler that a certain variable should not be modified once it has been initialized.</p>
